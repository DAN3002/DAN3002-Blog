I'm **Nguyễn Đình Anh**,

I had the opportunity to start college at the age of 16, and started working a year later (17 years old). My interests are in cloud computing as well as software development.

Along with that, I also have experience in teaching, I was recognized as an AWS Authorized Instructor and was the main instructor in 2 Bootcamps in Vietnam.

I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. If you would like to reach me, feel free to drop me a message in the email below.
